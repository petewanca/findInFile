# findInFile

drop file(s) in a 'dest' directory and search for matching values

to do:
boost user experience

-   user has to input within apostrophes, combine arg array to handle variable
-   user has to have node installed and use command line, create application they can download and run
-   user has to copy files from different dest into specified dir, fix that with path module
